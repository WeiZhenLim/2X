Despite this, some health systems treat it as a sunk cost or assume that their GPO is providing the best possible pricing.

However, there’s a smarter way for organizations to unlock significant cost savings, extend budgets, and ultimately improve patient access and outcomes. It starts by reviewing their non-clinical procurement approach. Find out how in our guide.

Last week, Becker's Healthcare reported on ten hospital closures and service reductions impacting the delivery of care in both large multi-facility health systems to smaller, community-based hospitals to home-based health service providers.

Creatively addressing and optimizing non-clinical/indirect spend – or expenses towards organizational needs not directly related to the cost of care delivery – is one path to help organizations like these fund critical services for their communities, including surgery, maternity, and home health.

On Tuesday, August 9th, LogicSource, Inc. and OneMarket Chief Operating Officer, Jo Seed and OneMarket Product Manager, Marissa Lindquist will be joined by Sourcing Industry Group (SIG) President, Dawn Tiura for the latest in SIG's Power Hour Webinar Series. 

In this session, the group will explore the critical gaps across today's Procurement technology landscape, and highlight why a new, innovative approach combining procurement-focused technology, expert support resources, market intelligence and price benchmarks can close the gaps for Procurement teams, and provide the solutions they need to elevate the profile and impact of Procurement at their organizations.

As cash-strapped systems face shrinking margins, supply chain disruptions, and rising labor costs, reining in the non-medical spend that typically equates to 20-25% of revenue has the potential to save them millions. However, without category expertise, a reliable ecosystem of suppliers, and a resilient, diverse supply chain, systems will struggle to realize the potential that effective management of indirect spending can provide.

While these services are helpful for mitigating clinical spending, there are limitations, most notably in the area of non-clinical expenditures. These costs, which can represent more than 20% of a health system's annual revenue, are often unique to an individual market or organization. A selection of national contracts does not always offer the best solution, or the best pricing. 

In this article, LogicSource, Inc. Healthcare Managing Director, Jonathan Shap, outlines five ways a strategic partnership focused on non-clinical goods and services can reduce costs and improve margins so that health systems can re-invest in patient care initiatives.

It's a tough needle to thread, but with an optimized approach to non-clinical spending—typically amounting to 20% or more of a health system's net-patient revenue—it could be possible to find opportunities for significant cost reductions. And when those savings get reinvested into patient care, your procurement function is materially improving patient outcomes.

In a recent interview with HealthLeaders, Keith Noll, Chief Administrative Officer for WellSpan Health, shared how partnering with LogicSource to revamp their non-clinical purchasing process resulted in first-year cost savings of $6 million, with the partnership on track to deliver more than $20 million in savings over the coming years.

Indirect goods and services typically consume more than 20% of an organization's revenue, yet this spending is often treated as merely “the cost of doing business.” The result is limited investment in the resources, technology, and sourcing discipline required for best-in-class buying.

If organizations want to turn their indirect procurement function into an engine for profit improvement, they need to take a disciplined approach and build the required competencies to ensure long-term success. Our quick guide highlights the five areas you must focus on to realize the untapped value within your indirect spending. Download it to find out more.
